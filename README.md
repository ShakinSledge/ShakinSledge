## Hi there 👋

<!--

## **Quick Bio:**

- 🎮 I'm a QA manual tester with aspirations to be the software or automation one in the future. I have over 3 years of professional experience now working on many various projects with different clients from the gamedev industry. It gave me not only a lot of experience in managing different client needs and fulfilling their expectations regarding games, but also made me a more confident person ready for any personal challenges 😄 I can say I'm a team player, both in life and work, whether it's learning a new software in work or helping wife in solving difficult problem, and I'm always trying to cooperate well with other people, learn from them, because I firmly believe they're the core of every project ^^ I don't often hesitate to ask if I'm not certain of something. If you want to do it right, then you have to be sure of it and better to ask the way than to go astray, eh? 😁

📑 **Professional Experience:** 

- Worked with almost every popular gaming platform including: PC (MacOS and Linux), PS4/PS5, XB1 and XBS/XBX, Switch, mobiles (iOS and Android), Steam Deck
- Conducted various manual tests such as regression, smoke testing, stress tests, performance, client's requests etc. 

⚙ **Tech Stack:**

- Jira (mostly), Mantis (~ 1 year), Azure DevOps (~ 8 months)
- Confluence (technical documentation mostly provided by clients) 
- Testrail (for managing testcases)
- TestFlight (iOS testing)
