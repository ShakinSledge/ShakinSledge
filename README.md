## Hello there 👋

🎮 **Quick Bio:**

- I'm a QA manual tester with aspirations to be the software or automation one in the future. I have over 3 years of professional experience now working on many various projects with different clients from the gamedev industry. It gave me not only a lot of experience in managing different client needs and fulfilling their expectations regarding games, but also made me a more confident person ready for any personal challenges 😄 I can say I'm a team player, both in life and work, whether it's learning a new software in work or helping wife in solving difficult problem, and I'm always trying to cooperate well with other people, learn from them, because I firmly believe they're the core of every project ^^ I don't often hesitate to ask if I'm not certain of something. If you want to do it right, then you have to be sure of it and better to ask the way than to go astray, eh? 😁 

📑 **Professional Experience:** 

- Worked with almost every popular gaming platform including: PC (MacOS and Linux), PS4/PS5, XB1 and XBS/XBX, Switch, mobiles (iOS and Android), Steam Deck
- Conducted various manual tests such as regression, smoke testing, stress tests, performance, destro, client's requests etc.
- Gained experience on many different projects: big, medium and small ones (AAA, AA and A)
- Shipped games like Alan Wake II (testing, managing a team of testers as POC and helping them if needed, creating and updating project documentation, maintaining project's bug     
  database in Jira, overseeing testplans and team tasks, pre-vetting bugs) and Fall Guys (managing a team of testers as POC and helping them if needed, installing builds and updating 
  software on Switch, maintaining bug database in Azure DevOps and Jira, overseeing testcases in Testrail, creating project documentation)

⚙ **Tech Stack:**

- Jira (mostly), Mantis (~ 1 year), Azure DevOps (~ 8 months)
- Confluence (using project technical documentation mostly provided by clients) 
- Testrail (to manage testcases)
- TestFlight (for iOS testing, install builds)
- Nintendo Switch SDK (updating software, install builds, testing)

🧠 **Skills:**

- Ability and eagerness to quickly learning new things like software tools, project workflow and client needs
- Quick adaptability to a new work environment
- Good prioritizing and organising my own work as well as being self-reliable  
- Critical thinking
- Good communication with other team members, leads, managers 

🌱 **Self-development:**

- I’m currently learning some Unreal Engine to better understand game design process from within, planning to gain ISTQB testing certificate and learning automation tools - Postman, Swagger and some SQL
