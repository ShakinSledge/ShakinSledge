## Hello there 👋

🎮 **Quick Bio:**

- I'm a QA manual tester with aspirations to be the software or automation one in the future. I have over 3 years of professional experience now working on many various projects with 
  different clients from the gamedev industry. It gave me not only a lot of experience in managing different client needs and fulfilling their expectations regarding games, but also made 
  me a more confident person ready for any personal challenges 😄 I can say I'm a team player, both in life and work, whether it's learning a new software in work or helping wife in 
  solving difficult problem, and I'm always trying to cooperate well with other people, learn from them, because I firmly believe they're the core of every project ^^ I don't often 
  hesitate to ask if I'm not certain of something. If you want to do it right, then you have to be sure of it and better to ask the way than to go astray, eh? 😁 

📑 **Professional Experience:** 

- Worked with almost every popular gaming platform including: PC (Windows and Linux), PS4/PS5, XB1 and XBS/XBX, Switch, mobiles (iOS and Android), Steam Deck
- Conducted various manual tests such as regression, smoke testing, stress tests, performance, destro, client's requests etc.
- Gained experience on many different projects: big, medium and small ones (AAA, AA and A)
- Helped with shipping games like Alan Wake II (testing, managing a team of testers as POC and helping them if needed, creating and updating project documentation, maintaining project's 
  bug database in Jira, overseeing testplans and team tasks, pre-vetting bugs) and Fall Guys (managing a team of testers as POC and helping them if needed, installing builds and updating 
  software on Switch, maintaining bug database in Azure DevOps and Jira, overseeing testcases in Testrail, creating project documentation)

⚙ **Tech Stack:**

- Jira (mostly), Mantis (~ 1 year), Azure DevOps (~ 8 months)
- Confluence (using project technical documentation mostly provided by clients) 
- Testrail (managing testcases)
- TestFlight (for iOS testing, installing builds)
- Nintendo Switch SDK (updating software, installing builds, testing)

🧠 **Skills:**

- Ability and eagerness to quickly learn new things like software tools, project workflow and client needs
- Quick adaptability to a new work environment
- Good tasks prioritizing and organising my own work as well as being self-reliable  
- Critical thinking
- Good communication with other team members, leads, managers 

🌱 **Self-development:**

- Currently learning some Unreal Engine to better understand game design process from within, planning to gain ISTQB testing certificate in 2025 and learning manual/automation 
  testing tools - Postman, Swagger, JQuery, some SQL etc.
- Will add some projects in Unreal Engine, C# or JavaScript in time here

🔍 **What am I looking for?**

- Stable company to work for which would let me grow as a tester
- Good professional connections
- Opportunities to learn automation in nice work environment
